# [Skribbl.io](http://skribbl.io) Drawing Tool

This is a tool I made intended for use on skribbl.io, but can probably be used with many drawing programs as well.

It works as folows:
 1. Take input word.
 2. Download images from bing images.
 3. Process image to get outlines.
 4. Draw the outlines on the canvas with mouse.
